I am an undergraduate student of Computer Science  at the National University of Lesotho(NUL). I am to complete my degree in the year 2026.



Bro, there is an upcoming conference and I need you to help me write the paper for it. It's speakable-2026. I am building Sesotho proverbs dataset. U know how long and detailed a paper needs to be, so I need all the help you can provide there and I want us to use simple words and let the science be the hard part about our paper.   So, I currently have 4 different voices reading out those LsMaele.txt . What I did was to receive a one long audio file from each speaker, then split it up so taht we have each audio corresp to one proverb. Also, we remove bg noise from any audio that may have one and we told our speakers to not start over in case of mistakes and we chop out those mistakes entirely. On the text part, I took some of the proverbs from the internet and in general, those are available in Southern Sotho, so I manually changed to Lesotho Sesotho and attached both files for u to see here.
